-- Problem 1. 25/25.

-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    

-- Problem 1. Write a function called "uniquemain" that checks that a program p has
--  precisely one function called "main". In particular, the behavior of uniquemain
--  is given below:
--
--    uniquemain p == Left p, if program p has one and only one function called "main"
--    uniquemain p == Right "No main procedure", if program p has no "main" procedure
--    uniquemain p == Right "Too many main procedures", if program p has more than one "main".

type ErrorMessage = String

--
-- The return type of uniquemain is written with Either; recall the Prelude definition of Either is:
--
--    data Either a b = Left a | Right b
--
-- We give uniquemain that return type so that it can return different error messages.
--
uniquemain :: Program -> Either Program ErrorMessage
ismain :: FunDecl -> Bool
ismain (FunDecl rt fun args locals body) = case fun of
                                         "main" -> True
                                         _ -> False

uniquemain (Program fds) = case length (filter ismain fds) of
                         0 -> Right "No main procedure"
                         1 -> Left (Program fds)
                         _ -> Right "Too many main procedures"



--
-- Hint: recall the Prelude function, filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
-- With filter, you can create a list of all function declarations of main within a program p.
-- Then, you can inspect the length of that list.
--


-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
--
-- Problem 2. 20/25. This one is a really simple problem that
-- people seemed to over-think.
--
-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    


-- Problem 2. Write a function called "symboltable" that computes a symbol table for a program.
--
-- Here, we will define a symbol table as the following:

type SymbolTable = [(Type, Name, [Decl], [Decl])]

-- Each entry in the symbol table, (t,f,params,locals), consists of a
--   * function declarations return type t,
--   * the function name f,
--   * params, and
--   * locals, which includes all declarations from the function parameters and
--     the local definitions.
-- Note that order matters in params and locals.

fundecl :: FunDecl -> (Type, Name, [Decl], [Decl])
fundecl (FunDecl rt fun args locals body) = (rt, fun, args, locals)
--                                                          ^^^^^^
-- "locals, which includes all declarations from the function parameters and
-- the local definitions." Your locals doesn't. -5

symboltable :: Program -> SymbolTable
symboltable (Program []) = []
symboltable (Program (x:xs)) = (fundecl x) : symboltable (Program xs)


-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
--
-- Problem 3. 25/25. Good.
--
-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    


-- Problem 3. Define a function, noundefined :: Program -> Bool, such that
--    noundefined (Program fds) == True if, and only if, there are no undefined program variables
-- in the bodies of the function declarations fds. Here, we say that a name is a "program variable"
-- if it is a function parameter or a locally defined variable. In other words, it is not a function
-- name.
--
-- The basic approach you will take to this problem is to check that the set of all program variables
-- *used* in a function body (which is a Cmd) is a subset of the set of all program variabled
-- *defined* in a function declaration.

--
-- Here is a helper function you may use.
--
subseteq :: Eq a => ([a],[a]) -> Bool
subseteq (x, y) = x `intersect` y == x

-- Here's how subseteq works:
--  ghci> subseteq [1,2,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [2,1,2,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [2,1,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [6] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   False

-- Here is the function you must define:
noundefined :: Program -> Bool
noundefined (Program []) = True
noundefined (Program (x:xs)) = subseteq (usedvars x, defvars x) && noundefined (Program xs)

--
-- I would suggest that you define the following helper functions.
--

decl :: Decl -> Name
decl (Decl a b) = a

-- This computes the names of all program variables defined in a FunDecl:
defvars :: FunDecl -> [Name]
defvars (FunDecl _ _ [] [] _) = []
defvars (FunDecl a b (p:ps) [] c) = [decl p] ++ defvars (FunDecl a b ps [] c)
defvars (FunDecl a b [] (l:ls) c) = [decl l] ++ defvars (FunDecl a b [] ls c)
defvars (FunDecl a b (p:ps) (l:ls) c) = [decl p] ++ [decl l] ++ defvars (FunDecl a b ps ls c)

-- This computes the names of all program variables in a FunDecl:
usedvars :: FunDecl -> [Name]
usedvars (FunDecl _ _ _ _ b) = varsCmd b

-- This computes all the names used in a Cmd:
varsCmd :: Cmd -> [Name]
varsCmd (Assign a b) = a:varsExp b
varsCmd (While a b) = varsExp a ++ varsCmd b
varsCmd (Seq a b) = varsCmd a ++ varsCmd b
varsCmd (IfThen a b) = varsExp a ++ varsCmd b
varsCmd (IfThenElse a b c) = varsExp a ++ varsCmd b ++ varsCmd c
varsCmd (Return a) = varsExp a
varsCmd _ = []

-- This computes all the names used in an Exp. Note that it is interdefined with varsCmd:
varsExp :: Exp -> [Name]
varsExp (Var a) = [a]
varsExp (UnaryOp a b) = varsExp b
varsExp (BinOp a b c) = varsExp b ++ varsExp c
varsExp (FunCall a []) = []
varsExp (FunCall a (x:xs)) = (varsExp x) ++ varsExp (FunCall a xs)
varsExp _ = []

-- Problem 4. 10/25. This problem was subtle and no one seems to have
-- gotten the point of analyzing the program "backwards" that I described
-- in class. Check the solutions.
--
-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

-- Problem 4. Write a function called "alwaysReturn" that checks whether a program
--  precisely one function called "main". In particular, the behavior of uniquemain
--  is given below:
--

alwaysReturn :: Program -> Either Program ErrorMessage
alwaysReturn (Program fds)
    | length (filter ismain fds) == 0 = Right "No main procedure"
    | length (filter ismain fds) > 1  = Right "Too many main procedures"
    | null cs = Left (Program fds)
    | otherwise = Right ("Following commands don't return:" ++ show cs)
    where cs = filter noreturn (map getcmd fds)

getcmd :: FunDecl -> Cmd
getcmd (FunDecl rt fun args locals body) = body


-- let bodies = map getcmd fds

-- let cs = filter noreturn bodies

-- if null cs then Left Program fds else Right ("Following commands don't return:" ++ show cs)


-- a. Create a list, bodies :: [Cmd], with all the bodies in the function declarations fds.
-- b. Write a function, noreturn :: Cmd -> Bool, so that
--      noreturn c == True if, and only if, c definitely returns.
-- c. Use filter, noreturn, and bodies to compute the list of all function bodies that definitely do no
--    return.
-- d. If the aforementioned list cs is empty, then alwaysReturn p == Left p; if cs is non-empty, then
--       alwaysReturn p == Right ("Following commands don't return:" ++ show cs)

-- Think carefully about noreturn, it should only return True if its argument *definitely* returns.

noreturn :: Cmd -> Bool
noreturn (While a b) = noreturn b
noreturn (Seq a b) = noreturn a && noreturn b
noreturn (IfThenElse a b c) = noreturn b || noreturn c
noreturn (Return _) = False
noreturn _ = True
