-- CS 4430/7430 Homework 3. Static Checks Homework.
-- Three Problems, each worth 25 points. 
-- Due: March 22nd @ 11:59pm

--
-- Directions:
--
-- To turn in your solution, please email me the code (harrisonwl@missouri.edu) with the subject 
-- "CS4430 HW3". It is important that you get this small detail right because otherwise I may miss 
-- your submitted solution. Your solution should be in the form of a single Haskell file named 
-- "Last-name_HW3.hs". So, if I did this homework, Iâ€™d turn in "Harrison_HW3.hs".
--
-- Please enter all the solutions to each problem here in this file. The file you email me must
-- load into GHCi in order to receive credit.
--
-- The problems are below. Please read through the following abstract syntax which we will also
-- discuss in class. You may define any helper functions you think are necessary.

  int main() { return fac(5) }

-- Problem 1. Write a function called "uniquemain" that checks that a program p has
--  precisely one function called "main". In particular, the behavior of uniquemain
--  is given below:    
--      
--    uniquemain p == Left p, if program p has one and only one function called "main"
--    uniquemain p == Right "No main procedure", if program p has no "main" procedure
--    uniquemain p == Right "Too many main procedures", if program p has more than one "main".

type ErrorMessage = String

--
-- The return type of uniquemain is written with Either; recall the Prelude definition of Either is:
--
--    data Either a b = Left a | Right b
-- 
-- We give uniquemain that return type so that it can return different error messages.
--
uniquemain :: Program -> Either Program ErrorMessage
uniquemain (Program fds) = undefined 

--
-- Hint: recall the Prelude function, filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
-- With filter, you can create a list of all function declarations of main within a program p.
-- Then, you can inspect the length of that list.        
--        


-- Problem 2. Write a function called "symboltable" that computes a symbol table for a program.
--
-- Here, we will define a symbol table as the following:

type SymbolTable = [(Type, Name, [Decl], [Decl])]

-- Each entry in the symbol table, (t,f,params,locals), consists of a
--   * function declarations return type t,
--   * the function name f,
--   * params, and
--   * locals, which includes all declarations from the function parameters and
--     the local definitions.
-- Note that order matters in params and locals.

symboltable :: Program -> SymbolTable
symboltable (Program fds) = undefined

-- Problem 3. Define a function, noundefined :: Program -> Bool, such that
--    noundefined (Program fds) == True if, and only if, there are no undefined program variables
-- in the bodies of the function declarations fds. Here, we say that a name is a "program variable"
-- if it is a function parameter or a locally defined variable. In other words, it is not a function
-- name.
--
-- The basic approach you will take to this problem is to check that the set of all program variables
-- *used* in a function body (which is a Cmd) is a subset of the set of all program variabled
-- *defined* in a function declaration.

--
-- Here is a helper function you may use.
--
subseteq :: Eq a => ([a],[a]) -> Bool
subseteq (x, y) = x `intersect` y == x

-- Here's how subseteq works:
--  ghci> subseteq [1,2,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [2,1,2,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [2,1,3] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   True
--  ghci> subseteq [6] [1,2,3,4,5]
--   False

-- Here is the function you must define:
noundefined :: Program -> Bool
noundefined (Program fds) = undefined

--
-- I would suggest that you define the following helper functions.
--

-- This computes the names of all program variables defined in a FunDecl:
defvars :: FunDecl -> [Name]
defvars (FunDecl _ _ params locals _) = undefined

-- This computes the names of all program variables in a FunDecl:
usedvars :: FunDecl -> [Name]
usedvars (FunDecl _ _ _ _ b) = undefined

-- This computes all the names used in a Cmd:
varsCmd :: Cmd -> [Name]
varsCmd c = undefined

-- This computes all the names used in an Exp. Note that it is interdefined with varsCmd:
varsExp :: Exp -> [Name]
varsExp e = undefined
