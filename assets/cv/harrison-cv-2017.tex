\subsection*{Comment on ``Cheap (But Functional) Threads''}

I submitted the article ``\emph{Cheap (But Functional) Threads}'' (CBFT) to the prestigious journal Higher-Order Symbolic Computation (HOSC) in 2008, and it was fully peer-reviewed and then accepted for publication by the HOSC editor-in-chief, Oliver Danvy in email in 2009:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{cheapthreads/OlivierAccepts.pdf}
\end{center}
I have removed the remainder of the email as it involves only specific editing details, etc.

CBFT is a journal version of an earlier conference publication ``\emph{The Essence of Multitasking}'' (AMAST 2006) and a pre-print version of the article has been present on my website for ten years or so. A number of researchers have made use of and cited CBFT; here's a list of recent citations:

\end{itemize}

CBFT has not yet appeared in print, despite having been accepted for publication at HOSC since late 2009. It is not clear, at this point, whether HOSC is still in operation. I have attempted to contact Olivier Danvy many, many times over the past several years to clarify the situation with HOSC and CBFT, but he has been unresponsive.


%The rest of that paragraph was too personal and giving them information they do not need and seems to indicate you and this fellow do not get along. Shortening it leaves it as ?you do not know what their issue is?. Also, do not use contractions like ?isn?t? in technical writing. 
%
%I would change the following paragraph to

CBFT has been extensively peer-reviewed, been accepted for publication at a prestigious journal, and has been, and continues to be, cited and downloaded from my web site by researchers in the programming languages community.

%CBFT has not yet appeared in print, despite having been accepted for publication at HOSC since late 2009. It isn't clear, at this point, whether HOSC is still in operation. I have attempted to contact Olivier Danvy many, many times over the past several years to clarify the situation with HOSC and CBFT, but he has been unresponsive. Olivier is an extremely brilliant and prominent member of the programming languages community. He and I have always been on friendly terms---he, in fact, was extremely supportive of my tenure case at MU and wrote a fantastic reference letter for me. But, to be blunt, he has become increasingly erratic and eccentric over the past ten years.

%The bottom line is that CBFT has been extensively peer-reviewed, been accepted for publication at a prestigious journal, and has been, and continues to be, cited by researchers in the programming languages community, but it has not yet appeared in print.
