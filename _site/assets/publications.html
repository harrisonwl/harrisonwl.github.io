There is no such thing as high assurance without high assurance hardware. High assurance hardware is essential, because any and all high assurance systems ultimately depend on hardware that conforms to, and does not undermine, critical system properties and invariants. And yet, high assurance hardware development is stymied by the conceptual gap between formal methods and hardware description languages used by engineers. This paper presents ReWire, a functional programming language providing a suitable foundation for formal verification of hardware designs, and a compiler for that language that translates high-level, semantics-driven designs directly into working hardware. ReWire's design and implementation are presented, along with a case study in the design of a secure multicore processor, demonstrating both ReWire's expressiveness as a programming language and its power as a framework for formal, high-level reasoning about hardware systems.

Although FPGAs have the potential to bring software-like flexibility and agility to the hardware world, designing for FPGAs remains a difficult task divorced from standard software engineering norms. A better programming flow would go far towards realizing the potential of widely deployed, programmable hardware. We propose a general methodology based on domain specific languages embedded in the functional language Haskell to bridge the gap between high level abstractions that support programmer productivity and the need for high performance in FPGA circuit implementations. We illustrate this methodology with a framework for regular expression to hardware compilers, written in Haskell, that supports high programmer productivity while producing circuits whose performance matches and, indeed, exceeds that of a state of the art, hand-optimized VHDL-based tool. For example, after applying a  novel optimization pass, throughput increased an average of 28.3 percent over the state of the art tool for one set of benchmarks.

The functional programming community has developed a number of powerful abstractions for dealing with diverse programming models in a modular way. Beginning with a core of pure, side effect free computation, modular monadic semantics (MMS) allows designers to construct domain-specific languages by adding layers of semantic features, such as mutable state and I/O, in an a' la carte fashion. In the realm of interpreter and compiler construction, the benefits of this approach are manifold and well explored. This paper advocates bringing the tools of MMS to bear on hardware design and verification. In particular, we shall discuss a prototype compiler called ReWire which translates high-level MMS hardware specifications into working circuits on FPGAs. This enables designers to tackle the complexity of hardware design in a modular way, without compromising efficiency.

Covert channels are mechanisms for communication where a legitimate channel carries a hidden message, and where the hidden message is conveyed using legal operations of the legitimate channel. Quantitative modeling of the response of the covert channel to noise results in an enhanced understanding of the channel and delimits the range of conditions under which a covert channel can operate effectively.

opportunity to investigate alternative formulations. As an example, we take
some of Savage's notions of decision theory and recast them within channel
theory. In place of probabilities, we use a particular logic of preference. We
introduce a logic for describing actions separate from the logic of preference
over actions. The structures introduced by channel theory that represent
the decision problems can be seen to be an abstract framework. This framework is very accommodating to changing the nature of the decision problems
to handle different aspects or theories about decision making.

holds (for partially ordered S4), and the Hilbert and Gentzen systems present the same logic. The partial

 RNA pseudoknot prediction using term rewriting.
 <em>International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics</em>.
[&nbsp;<a href="harrison.html_bib.html#ijdmb06">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
RNA plays a critical role in mediating every step of cellular information transfer from genes to functional proteins. Pseudoknots are functionally important and widely occurring structural motifs found in all types of RNA. Therefore predicting their structures is an important problem. In this paper, we present a new RNA pseudoknot structure prediction method based on term rewriting. The method is implemented using the Mfold RNA/DNA folding package and the term rewriting language Maude. In our method, RNA structures are treated as terms and rules are discovered for predicting pseudoknots.

Haskell is a functional programming language whose
                  evaluation is lazy by default. However, Haskell also
                  provides pattern matching facilities which add a
                  modicum of eagerness to its otherwise lazy default
                  evaluation. This mixed or <em>non-strict</em>
                  semantics can be quite difficult to reason
                  with. This paper introduces a programming logic,
                  P-Logic, which neatly formalizes the mixed
                  evaluation in Haskell pattern-matching as a logic,
                  thereby simplifying the task of specifying and
                  verifying Haskell programs. In P-Logic, aspects of
                  demand are reflected or represented within both the
                  predicate language and its model theory, allowing
                  for expressive and comprehensible program
                  verification.

Polymorphic recursion is a useful extension of Hindley-
Milner typing and has been incorporated in the functional programming
language Haskell. It allows the expression of efficient algorithms
that take advantage of non-uniform data structures and provides key
support for generic programming. However, polymorphic recursion is,
perhaps, not as broadly understood as it could be and this, in part,
motivates the denotational semantics presented here. The semantics reported
here also contributes an essential building block to any semantics
of Haskell: a model for first-order polymorphic recursion. Furthermore,
Haskell-style type classes may be described within this semantic framework
in a straightforward and intuitively appealing manner.

RNA plays a critical role in mediating every step of cellular information transfer from genes to functional proteins. Pseudoknots are widely occurring structural  motifs found in all types of RNA and are also functionally important. Therefore predicting their structures is an important problem. In this paper, we present a new RNA pseudoknot prediction model based on term rewriting rather than on dynamic programming, comparative sequence analysis, or context-free grammars. The model we describe is implemented using the Mfold RNA/DNA folding package and the term rewriting language Maude. Our model was tested on 211 pseudoknots in PseudoBase and achieves an average accuracy of 74.085% compared to the experimentally determined structure. In fact, most pseudoknots discovered by our method achieve an accuracy of above 90%. These results indicate that term rewriting has a broad potential in RNA applications from prediction of pseudoknots to higher level RNA structures involving complex RNA tertiary interactions.

This paper advocates a novel approach to language-based security: by structuring software with monads (a form of abstract data type for effects), we are able to maintain separation of effects by construction. The thesis of this work is that well-understood properties of monads and monad transformers aid in the construction and verification of secure software. We introduce a formulation of non-interference based on monads rather than the typical trace-based formulation. Using this formulation, we prove a non-interference style property for a simple instance of our system model. Because monads may be easily and safely represented within any pure, higher-order, typed functional language, the resulting system models may be directly realized within such a language.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Functional languages have the lambda calculus at their core, but then depart from this firm foundation by including features that alter their default evaluation order. The resulting mixed evaluation---partly lazy and partly strict---complicates the formal semantics of these languages. The functional language Haskell is such a language, with features such as pattern-matching, case expressions with guards, etc., introducing a modicum of strictness into the otherwise lazy language. But just how does Haskell differ from the lazy lambda calculus? We answer this question by introducing a calculational semantics for Haskell that exposes the interaction of its strict features with its default laziness. In the semantics, features perturbing Haskell's standard lazy evaluation order are specified computationally (i.e., monadically) rather than as pure values (i.e., functions, scalars, etc.).

Profile-driven compiler optimizations take advantage of information gathered at runtime to re-compile programs into more efficient code. Such optimizations appear to be more easily incorporated within a semantics-directed compiler structure than within traditional compiler structure. We present a case study in which a metacomputation-based reference compiler for a small imperative language converts easily into a compiler which performs a particular profile-driven optimization: local register allocation. Our reference compiler is implemented in the staged, functional language MetaML and takes full advantage of the synergy between metacomputation-style language definitions and the staging constructs of MetaML. We believe that the approach to implementing profile-driven optimizations presented here suggests a useful, formal model for dynamically adaptable software.

This thesis explores the construction and correctness of modular compilers. Modular compilation is a compiler construction technique allowing the construction of compilers for high-level programming languages from reusable compiler building blocks. Modular compilers are defined in terms of denotational semantics based on monads, monad transformers, and a new model of staged computation called metacomputations. A novel form of denotational specification called observational program specification and related proof techniques are developed to assist in modular compiler verification. It will be demonstrated that the modular compilation framework provides both a level of modularity in compiler proofs as well as a useful organizing principle for such proofs.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents a modular and extensible style of language specification based on metacomputations. This style uses two monads to factor the static and dynamic parts of the specification, thereby staging the specification and achieving strong binding-time separation. Because metacomputations are defined in terms of monads, they can be constructed modularly and extensibly using monad transformers. Consequently, metacomputation-style specifications are modular and extensible. A number of language constructs are specified: expressions, control-flow, imperative features, block structure, and higher-order functions and recursive bindings. Because of the strong binding-time separation, metacomputation-style specification lends itself to semantics-directed compilation, which we demonstrate by creating a modular compiler for a block-structured imperative, while language.

The monadic style of language specification has the
                 advantages of modularity and extensibility: it is
                 simple to add or change features in an interpreter to
                 re ect modifications in the source language. It has
                 proven difficult to extend the method to compilation.
                 We demonstrate that by introducing machine-like stores
                 (code and data) into the monadic semantics and then
                 partially evaluating the resulting semantic
                 expressions, we can achieve many of the same advantages
                 for a compiler as for an interpreter. A number of
                 language constructs and features are compiled:
                 expressions, CBV and CBN evaluation of
                 &lambda;-expressions, dynamic scoping, and various
                 imperative features. The treatment of recursive
                 procedures is outlined as well. The resulting method
                 allows compilers to be constructed in a mix-and-match
                 fashion just as in a monad-structured interpreter.
