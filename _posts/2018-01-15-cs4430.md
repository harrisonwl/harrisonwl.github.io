### Haskell Platform

There are many versions of Haskell floating around out there. The one that you should use is
the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. The Haskell Platform is the most up-to-date, most stable version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) available.

For emacs users, there is also a special Haskell mode for editing Haskell: it is available
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">here</a>.

### Textbooks

Our textbook be mainly my slides, but there is a good online Haskell text for your edification:

* <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You A Haskell for Great Good: A Beginners Guide</a> by Miran Lipovaca.


### Announcements

* 1/17/18: __All__ programming assignments will be done in Haskell. If you do not know the Haskell language now, you will have to come up to speed with it mostly on your own. We will do _some_ review of the language in the first week.


### Slides

Note that these slides and code examples may change during or shortly after the lecture as I add or modify things.
