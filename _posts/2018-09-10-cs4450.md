### Haskell Platform

There are many versions of Haskell floating around out there. The one that you should use is
the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. The Haskell Platform is the most up-to-date, most stable version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) available.

For emacs users, there is also a special Haskell mode for editing Haskell: it is available
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">here</a>.

### Textbooks

Both of our textbooks are online:

* <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You A Haskell for Great Good: A Beginners Guide</a> by Miran Lipovaca.
* <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/anatomy/">Anatomy of Programming Languages</a> by William Cook. <a href="https://github.com/w7cook/AoPL">Here</a> is the github repository that contains all the code. It's under _src_.


### Announcements

* We will have a midterm on Friday, 10/5/18, in class.

### Homeworks

* Solutions for HW1 are <a href="https://harrisonwl.github.io/assets/courses/popl/fall2018/homework/HW1/SolutionsHW1.hs">here</a>.
