### Haskell Platform

There are many versions of Haskell floating around out there. The one that you should use is
the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. The Haskell Platform is the most up-to-date, most stable version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) available.

For emacs users, there is also a special Haskell mode for editing Haskell: it is available
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">here</a>.

### Textbooks

Both of our textbooks are online:

* <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You A Haskell for Great Good: A Beginners Guide</a> by Miran Lipovaca.
* <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/anatomy/">Anatomy of Programming Languages</a> by William Cook.


### Slides

Note that these slides and code examples may change during or shortly after the lecture as I add or modify things.

Note that we're still doing some of the exercises in this code, so it will change after each successive class until we're done.

* 9/19/16: Here are the slides for  <a href="https://harrisonwl.github.io/assets/courses/popl/fall2016/slides/chapter4.pdf">Chapter 4</a> of LYAHFGG. Also,
  <a href="https://harrisonwl.github.io/assets/courses/popl/fall2016/slides/Class0912.hs">class code</a> and code for   <a href="https://harrisonwl.github.io/assets/courses/popl/fall2016/slides/chapter5.hs">Chapter 5</a>.
