### Haskell Platform

There are many versions of Haskell floating around out there. The one that you should use is
the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. The Haskell Platform is the most up-to-date, most stable version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) available.

For emacs users, there is also a special Haskell mode for editing Haskell: it is available
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode">here</a>.

### Textbooks

Our textbooks are:

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Machines-Reinhard-Wilhelm/dp/3642149081/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1548255410&sr=1-1">Compiler Design: Virtual Machines</a> by Reinhard Wilhelm and Helmut Seidl. 

* <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You A Haskell for Great Good: A Beginners Guide</a> by Miran Lipovaca.
